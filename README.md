Problem Statement: Implement ARIMA model to forecast the air quality using Beijing air quality dataset

Module: Business Analytics 

Project Type: Team 

Objective: 
- perform EDA on time series data
- analyze the auto correlation and partial auto correlation plots
- implement the ARIMA model and forecast the air quality

Theory: 

ARIMA stands for auto-regressive integrated moving average. It’s a way of modelling time series data for forecasting (i.e., for predicting future points in the series), in such a way that:
- a pattern of growth/decline in the data is accounted for (“auto-regressive” part)
- the rate of change of the growth/decline in the data is accounted for (the “integrated” part)
- noise between consecutive time points is accounted for (the “moving average” part)
